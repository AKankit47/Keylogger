## **Introduction**
Keylogging is the process of monitoring and recording user keyboard input. This project is a simple implementation of a keylogger using Python's `pynput` library, intended to help students and cybersecurity enthusiasts understand keylogging concepts in a safe and ethical context.

---

## **Features**
- Logs both alphanumeric and special keys (e.g., Enter, Space, Backspace).
- Saves captured keystrokes to a local file (`keylog.txt`).
- Lightweight and minimalistic.
- Easy-to-understand code for learning purposes.
- Stops logging upon pressing the `ESC` key.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- Python library: `pynput`

Install the required library:
```bash
pip install pynput
```
